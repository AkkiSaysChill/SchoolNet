## note for Team D1369SR2

these are the reason due to which our application failed
otherwise it is a good apllication.
we failed because of time management lack of co-ordination
aur thoda to ihfc ko blame kerna bnta hai sado k management bhi bekar tha >\_<

but I feel like I could have managed our time better, and I'm sorry for that. But I’m so proud we made it to Nationals together.
